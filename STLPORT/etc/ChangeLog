	* Macro _STLP_NO_SGI_IOSTREAMS renamed to _STLP_NO_OWN_IOSTREAMS, old references to SGI removed; 
	
	* "prepare" target added to all makefiles in src/; should be run before using STLport;
	  on most platforms it's empty, on some of them it creates necessary symbolic links, etc.
	
	* stl/_deque.h : deque<>::erase bug (introduced in 4.1b4) fixed (thanks to BruceFlorman)

	* All internal macros changed to have prefix _STLP_ instead of __STL or __STLPORT or __SGI_STL.
          That is to allow seamless wrapping on platforms that use SGI STL as native STL/iostreams.
	  For backward compatibility, most of user-settable __STL_xxx macros are accepted.

The following changes were made in 4.1 beta 4 since 4.1 beta 3 :
	
	* Simulation of class partial specialization (thanks to  Mat Marcus and Jesse Jones of Adobe)
	  used to provide following enhancements :
	
	 - type_traits are automatically specialized for all pointer types for all compilers, 
	   which makes them able to utilize type_traits-based optimizations when dealing with pointer types, 
	   automatically.
	
	 - all functions specialized for pointers and optimized via __type_traits
	   ( like copy()/copy_backward(), _uninitialized_xx) now enjoy this optimization for all compilers!
        
	- generic __value_type()/__difference_type()/__iterator_category() are written so user does not have
	   to supply any of its own even when partial specialization is not available.
	   (Note : gcc-2.7 and VC++ 5.x, 6.x have bugs which prevents them from using this enhancement, still)
	
	* <iterator> : by default, non-standard iterator query names like 
	  value_type()/difference_type()/iterator_category() are not used
	
	* <algo> : major revision:
	   - algorithms without explicit Compare() function expressed via the one that has it where possible.
	     This considerably reduces header size and reduces code bloat for programs which use both flavours of
	     those algorithms.
	   - some function bodies moved between  .c and .h 
	   - all functions used internally moved out to _algobase.h, so no other header includes <_algo.h> anymore
	   - find() specialized for random access iterators regardless of partial spec.

	* Dynamic libraries (.DLL and .so) : name versioning used to prevent clashes between STLport versions

	* src/ : code regrouped between .cpp files to provide for less executable size with dumb linkers;

	* locale subsystem initialization : startup changed to use statically allocated structures as much as possible;
	
	* <stl/_function.h> : basic stuff moved to _function_base.h ; 
	  other STL headers now include _function_base.h instead

	* _threads.h : MT support for OS/2 added (only tested with VAC++)

	* _stdio_file.h : added support for Solaris in ELF64 mode (thanks to Holger Stasch)
	
	* stl/_hashtable.h : [] operator for hash_map optimized to take no more than find() when element is present
	  (Thanks to Thomas Witt et al.)

	* _ostream.h : fix for default unsigned char (thanks to  Holger Stasch)
	
	* all __STL_ABBREVS abbreviations moved aside in _abbrevs.h header.

	* Fujitsu C++ Compiler support added (thanks to  Holger Stasch)

	* _bitset.h - member workaround operators made const (thanks to dzwick) 

	* _bitset.h/.c, hashtable.h -- small bugfixes (thanks to Levente Farkas)
	
	* <exception> - now includes exception.h if only that is available.

	* vector::assign() inplemented for vector::iterator when member templates are not available (Thanks to dzwick)

	* fstream.cpp : __pioinfo used for MinGW32 (thanks to Danny Smith)
	
The following changes were made in 4.1 beta 3 since 4.1 beta 2 :

	* list<>::clear() : protected access bug fixed

	* __STL_MUTEX_INITIALIZER set back to PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER for pthreads case, 
	  as some platforms (eg AIX) do not treat zero-initialized mutex as valid one (thanks to Alex Vanic, Jack Andrews for help)
	
	* stl/_limits.c : fixed typo preventing numeric limits constants to be defined for __STL_LITTLE_ENDIAN,
	  constants initialization fixed (thanks to Ingo Donasch)  

	* real implementation of locales for Win32 contributed by Anton Lapach (thanks !) merged in.
	
	* stl_user_config.h, _config.h : changed default to not define relops:: operators
	  in __STL_NO_NAMESPACES mode.

	* _numeric_facets.c/num_put.cpp : printing of integer do not use sprintf() anymore

	* "install" target implemented for UNIX & VC++ Makefiles. It now installs headers and libraries.

	* "src" : files merged to get less compilation time and less space overhead for imperfect compilers

	* "debug" flavour of STLport excluded from default build and auto-select ; 
	  please use __STL_USE_DEBUG_LIB and build debug STLport lib explicitly with "make debug_dynamic" 
	  if you really need it). "all" now builds 2 kinds : "release" and "STLdebug", for static and dynamic builds.  

	* stlport_prefix.h : WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN set for Win32 build of STLport library, for speed.

	* FreeBSD compile fixed; makefiles added.
