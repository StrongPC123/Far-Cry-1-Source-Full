Bink is not copy protected, but <i>it is copyrighted</i>. We think our license agreements are fair, and that our software is reasonably priced for the quality and effort we have put into it.

So, if you hate 'em, then it's my fault. But if you like them, well, that's my fault too... Special thanks to Mitch Soule, John Miles, Casey Muratori, Mike Sartain, Mike Abrash, Steve Theodore, and my wife, Alicia Fukunaga, someone I try to be more like. Lee Powell wrote most of the terrific optimized x86 YUV conversion routines in Bink. John Miles wrote the original speedy x86 YUV convertors. Mark Engelberg and Jeff Roberts did the original research work on Bink. David Lawrence at Blizzard did much of the heavy lifting of porting Bink to MacOS (and he tolerated many questions). Mike Sartain did the port to GameCube and wrote several of the Xbox examples. Thanks also to Brian Kearney, Ken Coburn, Chris Hecker, Access Software, Microsoft (both for the nice tools and the tough competition), and all our Bink and Smacker licensees. RAD's automatic documentation system was written by Casey Muratori.
