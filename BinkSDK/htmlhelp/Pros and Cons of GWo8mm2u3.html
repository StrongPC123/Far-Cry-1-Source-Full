<h1>Pros and Cons of GWorld Blitting under MacOS</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p><b>GWorld blitting is good, because:</b> 1) It is the most compatible way of getting pixels onto the screen. They will always work. 2) GWorlds can perform clipping during blitting. 3) GWorlds can be scaled to any resolution - not just 2x (this is usually slow, though). <br> <b>GWorld blitting is bad, because:</b> 1) GWorlds are slow! Even if CopyBits was perfect (which it ain't), there still is an extra frame buffer blit compared to direct-to-screen. 3) GWorlds use more memory. Again, because there is an extra frame buffer, they require more memory than direct-to-screen. </p>
