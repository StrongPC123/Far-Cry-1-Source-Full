<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p> <br> <br> <b>First off, welcome to the Bink SDK, and thanks for your purchase!</b> This documentation will describe the Bink SDK for Win32, Xbox and MacOS programmers. We spend quite a bit of time working on our docs and hope they get you up and running fast. Please give us feedback on what worked for you and what didn't. Just as with the Bink API itself, we strive for continual improvement in our documentation as well. Your feedback is crucial in this regard! Also note that this manual actively updated, so be sure to check out these docs whenever you receive a new Bink version, so that you don't miss anything! The "Bink Overview" chapter of this manual is designed to give you a broad overview of Bink. This is the chapter to read when you're just starting out with our video APIs. Bink is very similar to Smacker, so you Smacker users will have a head-start. The "Bink under Win32" chapter will walk you through the details of using Bink under the weird but strangely compelling Win32 platform. This chapter will discuss how to use Bink specifically under the Microsoft operating systems. The "Bink on Nintendo GameCube" chapter will walk you through the details of using Bink on Nintendo's new GameCube video game console. This chapter will discuss how to use Bink specifically under this great little console. The "Bink on Xbox" chapter will walk you through the details of using Bink on Microsoft's new Xbox video game console. This chapter will discuss how to use Bink specifically under this terrific environment. The "Bink under MacOS" chapter will walk you through the details of using Bink under the aging MacOS 9 platform and the new MacOS X platform. This chapter will discuss how to use Bink specifically under Apple's operating systems. Finally, we'll wrap up with the reference section of our documentation. These reference chapters will describe each and every function in both the Bink API and our blitting API (the BinkBuffer API). Also, note that our printed documentation doesn't include everything in the online documentation. Check out the online documentation for fully hyper-linked and cross-referenced discussions - it's awesome! Again, please send feedback to me as you use Bink - what confused you, what you liked, what you hated, what you'd like to see in future versions, etc. Your feedback is what will keep Bink vital, fun to use, and powerful into the future! Thanks again, <br> Jeff Roberts - RAD Game Tools - <a href="mailto:bink1@radgametools.com">E-mail</a>. </p>
