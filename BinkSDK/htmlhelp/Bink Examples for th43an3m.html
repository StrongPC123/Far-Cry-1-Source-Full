<h1>Bink Examples for the Nintendo GameCube</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The Bink SDK supplies several example programs for Nintendo GameCube. To create these examples with SN Systems or CodeWarrior, just create a new project and include the appropriate C source file (ExamNbb.C, ExamNTex.C or ExamNAlf.C), and then add the Bink for Nintendo GameCube static library to the project (BinkNGC.a). <br> The following is a list of the example files that you can experiment with: <br> For an example of using Bink to display a video directly to the GameCube's YUV back buffer, see the <b>"ExamNbb.C"</b> file. This example is extremely simple because it doesn't use the GPU to render the video - it's just blasts it right to the back buffer. It's also very fast, because Bink doesn't have to convert out of YUV format. <br> For an example of using Bink to decompress onto a texture and then render the texture to the screen, see the <b>"ExamNTex.C"</b> file. This example uses our simple 3D wrapper, so be sure to also add the <b>"NGCRAD3D.C"</b> file to your project. Bink converts from YUV format directly into the GameCube's swizzled format inside the <a href="BinkCopyToBuffer.html">BinkCopyToBuffer</a> function, so you can render the texture immediately! For an example of using Bink with alpha videos and then render the textures to the screen, see the <b>"ExamNAlf.C"</b> file. This example also uses our simple 3D wrapper, so be sure to also add the <b>"NGCRAD3D.C"</b> file to your project. You can download a small alpha test movie from our ftp-site<ftp://ftp.radgametools.com/bink>. All of these examples also use a simple file to setup the GameCube for use, so you'll also need to include "NGCDemo.c" in your sample projects. </p>
