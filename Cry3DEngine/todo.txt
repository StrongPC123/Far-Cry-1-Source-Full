Console changes (move working compiled cgf code into resource compiler tool(now I waiting for indoor and shadow volume changes))
Water distortion
Water distortion texture
Rain on screen 1
Shadow maps generalization (shadow maps on particles, indoors.. each lsource and entity has flags to cast stencil or smaps )

Finalize stencil for outdoors
Restore terrain modifications
Finetune complex decals on entities
Real time update in editor of layered fog and other volumes/elements
Make list of attached particle sprays in the entity class, remove part sys calls every frame from script
Slow lod switch for static objects (research) 
Decals bending with trees
Finish beaches (fix visual bugs, more control for designers)
Finish weather/dragonfly
Rocket affects particles movement
Physiclicaly correct breakable glass
Editor: automatic objects brightness calculations: 3 groups of objects on terrain: on light, in shadow from tree, in shadow from mountain
Improve HW occlusion culling
Water: switch back to old radial system?
Try to render real objects instead detail objects to give more freedom to artists
Adjustable density for detail objects (per type)
Mirrored trees (instead rotation)
Point sprite extension research
Tesselate terrain light pass to get shadow maps from point lsources in one pass
'Update shadow every frame' flag for trees and entities in editor
Use LeafBuffer callcback for terrain ant other procedural
Reload IStatObj
Random particles bouncing
Fixed loading address for DDLs
Editable voxel space research
Beaches slow dissapearing on distance
