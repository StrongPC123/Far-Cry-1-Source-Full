TODO List

- Seperate texture coordinate generation from rasterization
- Compute LMs for all LOD versions
- Fix spotlights
- Indiviual texel size for each GLM
- Improve dialog, i.e. separate output for errors, stop calculation
- Migrate raster table to polybump version
- Selective recomputation should recompute regions that were obscured by moved geometry
  = rebuild changes with Ivo cullingcode
- Generate triangle strips (quad = 4 vertices, not 6) 
- Optimize lightpatches (not always 4x4)
- subsampling not only for shadows

later:

- Merge faces that span across multiple GLMs
- Shadows from transparent textures / alpha textures
- Monte Carlo ray tracing for Radiosity



done:

- Replace 'sub-sampling' setting with more descriptive variant
- Obtain tangent space from Leaf Buffer, remove replicated material sorting
